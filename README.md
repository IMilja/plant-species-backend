# Plant Species Backend
This repository contains the backend API built for my (Professional) Master thesis where I developed an application for storing information about different plant species, subspecies, useful parts and etc.

This API is build on top of NodeJs and is build as a REST API containing GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods for the selected resources.
This backend also has an implemantaion of authentication endpoints and functionalities like password reset as well as authorization so POST, PATCH and DELETE methods can only be accessed by users
with the role SUPER_ADMIN.
